👋 About Me
Hi 👋
I'm Rafa Khoiron Alif, a 17 years old Web Developer and Senior High School student from Indonesia.

I enjoy building web applications in a local development environment, understanding how servers work, and learning backend development step by step.

🔌 Local Development Workflow
I prefer developing applications locally first to fully understand how systems work before deployment.

🧱 Local Setup
OS: Windows 11 & Kali Linux
Server: Apache, PHP, MySQL (XAMPP)
Editor: VS Code / Visual Studio
Version Control: Git & GitHub
This workflow helps me understand server behavior, debugging, and backend logic more deeply.
